# Data directory for SQLite databases

This directory contains:
- `user_data.db` - User vocabulary records (auto-created)
- `ecdict.db` - ECDICT dictionary (needs to be downloaded separately)

## Download ECDICT

Download the ECDICT SQLite database from:
https://github.com/skywind3000/ECDICT/releases

Extract and rename to `ecdict.db`, then place it in this directory.

Without the dictionary, the API will work but won't provide translations.
